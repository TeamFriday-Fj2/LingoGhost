## Agentic Language Tutor: Gemini 3

We leveraged the **Gemini 1.5 Flash** model for its ultra-low latency, ensuring that "ghost" options and translations generate instantly. Our sophisticated prompt engineering instructs the AI to:
1.  **Deep Context Analysis**: Analyze the surrounding DOM context for pinpoint accuracy.
2.  **Morphological Distractor Generation**: Generate options that are morphologically and contextually similar to the correct answer to enhance pedagogical memory.
3.  **Consistent Persona**: Maintain the "Mischievous Teacher" personality throughout all interactions.

## Technical Implementation

* **Core Logic**: Developed using **Chrome Extension API (Manifest V3)** for real-time DOM injection and mutation observation.
* **Performance Engineering**: Optimized text-matching and replacement algorithms to ensure zero lag during webpage rendering.
* **Infrastructure**: Hosted under the **TeamFriday-Fj2** organization for a modular and scalable codebase.

## What's Next? (Roadmap)

* **Gamified Pts System**: Implementing a feedback loop (+10 for a "Catch", -5 for a "Glitch") to boost engagement.
* **Learning State Synthesis**: An AI Mentor feature that analyzes interaction data to generate personalized summaries of cognitive progress.
* **WebAssembly (WASM)**: Transitioning core logic to **Rust** for lightning-fast, large-scale text processing.
* **Visual Learning**: Integrating Gemini's multi-modal powers to label objects in images on the fly.
